	  <h1>Traveling Through Time</h1>
	  <p><img src="blogpictures'nlogo/trojan_war_img.jpg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">I think if I could travel back to one event in history,</span> I’d probably travel back to the Trojan War. While sources are conflicted as to how it started and what it was fought over, I think it would nevertheless be exciting to see a war of mythic proportions take place before my eyes. At the same time, many monuments, architecture, and even culture lost to the sands of time would live as though they had never deteriorated, and learning about those alone would probably be the most interesting part of the journey.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Taken, I don’t know if the time machine would also give me a universal translator to be able to converse with the contemporaries of the time (or for that matter, any other comforts, like antibiotics), but in the case it did, gaining a firsthand perspective into the thoughts of the people living through the height of Ancient Greece would be worthwhile any problems, like the aforementioned extinct bacteria, indeed.&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>Superpowers</h1>
	  <p><img src="blogpictures'nlogo/matter_manipulation_img.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="170" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'">Without a doubt, if I had a chance to choose a superpower,</span> I would pick matter manipulation. Matter manipulation would allow me to change the form and shape of anything, including me and my surroundings - if this ability came with the added power to revert things back to their original form, and change things at will, I could instantly give myself any other power I wanted, and shape the world at whim.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>If I wanted to ride a motorcycle for the day, or sport a slick back haircut, I could think of it and it would happen; I would be able to design space ships and terraform planets; this would also mean I could change the way humans think, allowing me to teach myself new languages or even realign the values of political and corporate leaders to serve the common people. Or I may just add more ketchup to my burger without touching the bottle. The possibilities are endless, and ethics aside, matter manipulation would definitely be what I would choose.&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>Most Important Invention</h1>
	  <p><img src="blogpictures'nlogo/driftcar3.jpeg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-family: amboy-inline, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 16px;">This isn’t the most thoughtful answer, but to me, the most important invention of all time in the <strong>automobile</strong>.</span> What other piece of technology allows you to physically get around quickly, reach speeds incapable naturally to man, tour the wilderness, express your individuality, and sits in your driveway ready to go? There are many problems that afflict them, including mechanically, and how they harm the environment, but I haven’t been able to find anything more fun that involves just you and a machine that allows you to learn more things about you and the world, and is completely customizable to you. &nbsp;</p>
